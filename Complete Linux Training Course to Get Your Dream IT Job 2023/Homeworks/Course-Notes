find - 
locate -

- File Permisions
d - directory

- User Administration:
passwd [userName] - change user password
ACL (Access Control List) - gives an user or a group more flexible permissions to access, edit or execute directories and files.
If some user is not part of the group of a directory, we can add him in the ACL and he will be able to access this directory.

	setfacl -m g:group:rw /path/to/file - add permissions for a group
	setfacl -Rm "entry" /path/to/file - allow all files or directories to inherit ACL entries from the directory it is within
	setfacl -x u:user /path/to/file - remove a specific entry (for specific user)
	setfacl -b /path/to/file - remove all entries (for all users)

getfacl /path/to/file - get all entries for the specific file
