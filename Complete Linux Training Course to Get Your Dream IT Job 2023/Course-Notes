File System Structure:
/ - root directory (the start of the entire file system)
/boot - contains files that are used by the boot loader (grub.cfg)
/root - root user home directory
/etc - contains configuration files
/bin - user commands (/bin, /usr/bin)
/sbin - system/file system commands (/usr/sbin)
/opt - optional add-on applications (not part of the OS apps)
/proc - running processes (only exist in memory)
/lib - C programming library files needed by commands and apps (/usr/lib)
/tmp - directory for temporary files
/home - home directory of every user
/var - system logs 
/run - System daemons that start very early (systemd and udev) to store temporary runtime files like PID files
/mnt - to mount external filesystem (NFS) e.g. for things like external hard drives, flash drives etc.
/media - for cdrom mounts

Commands:
whoami - shows the current logged in user
pwd - print working directory

- Navigating through the files system
cd - change directory
	- ./ - current directory
	- ../ - parent directory
	- Relative Path - It identifies a location relative to you current position (/OperatingSystems/Lectures/)
	- Absolute Path - Always begins with /. It is the path from the root directory to the current position (/home/userName/OperatingSystems/Lectures/)
ls - list
find - 
locate -

- File Permisions
d - directory
- - regular file
l - link
c - special file or device file
s - socket
p - named pipe
b - block device

ls -l Structure:
Type	# of Links	Owner	Group	Size	Month	Day	Time	Name	

- User Administration:
passwd [userName] - change user password
ACL (Access Control List) - gives an user or a group more flexible permissions to access, edit or execute directories and files.
If some user is not part of the group of a directory, we can add him in the ACL and he will be able to access this directory.
setfacl
	setfacl -m u:user:rwx /path/to/file - add perfmissions for user
	setfacl -m g:group:rw /path/to/file - add permissions for a group
	setfacl -Rm "entry" /path/to/file - allow all files or directories to inherit ACL entries from the directory it is within
	setfacl -x u:user /path/to/file - remove a specific entry (for specific user)
	setfacl -b /path/to/file - remove all entries (for all users)

getfacl /path/to/file - get all entries for the specific file

useradd - add user
userdel - remove user
	userdel -r userName - remove user, home directory and email spool
usermod - modify user account
groupadd
groupdel

- Creating Files and Directories:
mkdir - make directory
rmdir - remove empty directories
rm - remove files and directories (you can also remove directories - recursivly)
touch - create files
cp - copy file/files
	cp -R source desitnation - copy directories recursivly
mv - move (can be used to rename files aswell)

- Streams:
0 - stdin
1 - stdout
2 - stderr

>> - append to a file
> - overwrite file

- Standard output to file: 		Use case: (echo "testing tee" | tee testingFile)
tee

- Pipe ( | ):
command1 [arguments] | command2 [arguments] 		- pipe is used to redirect stdout of one command to stdin of another command

- Networking Basics:
	
	Basic Terms:
	- IP (Internet Protocol) - identity number for each user in the network
		- IPv4
		- IPv6
	- Subnet Mask - 32-bit number that masks an IP Address, and divides the IP address into network and host address.  
	- Gateway (usualy the ip address of the router in a home network) - the gate that is used to access networks outside of our local area network (a.k.a. the Internet).
	
	- Static vs DHCP IP Addresses - when Static IP is set, it does not change. When the PC is restared it stays the same, while if we use DHCP, the computer will automatically pick one IP from pool of available addresses and it will change everytime we start the computer.

	- Interface (usually this is the Network Card or Wifi Card on laptops) - this is the device that allows the computer to connect to networks and Internet.
	- MAC Address - is the physical address of the Interface card. Every Interface card has a MAC Address. It is permanent and it cannot be changed.	
	
	- OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)
	- NIC (Network Interface Controller)

	Address Class		Bits for Subnet Mask			Subnet Mask	Subnet Mask

	Class A			11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000	255.0.0.0	/8
	Class B			11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000	255.255.0.0	/16
	Class C			11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000	255.255.255.0	/24

	
	Network File and Commands:
	- Interface Detection
	- Assign IP Address

	- Network Configuration Files
		- /etc/nsswitch.conf - tells the system where it should resolve its host name to ip address.
		- /etc/hosts - this is where you define your system host name and IP Address (it's like a small version of DNS).
		- /etc/sysconfig/network (CentOS 6) - This is the file where you specify your host name and other parameters.
		- /etc/hostname (CentOS 7) - The file where you specify your host name.
		- /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-nic - this is the file of the computer interface (network card). Here you can define IP, Gateway, Subnet mask, etc.
		- /etc/resolv.conf - specifies the DNS server

	- Network Commands
		- ping	- send and recieve packets to specific IP address
		- ifconfig - shows the computer's interfaces
		- ifup / ifdown - you can shut down and start different interfaces
		- netstat - tell you about the traffic flow of the network, gateway, to which inteface it is going and others.
			- rnv
		- tcpdump - traces every transaction that is coming in and going out of the machine (every packet that goes in and out).

	NIC (Network Interface Card) Information:

	Exampple of NIC
	- enp0s3 - Ethernet interface card
	- lo	 - 127.0.0.1 (the loop back interface - it is used, so the PC can communicate with itself. It is used for diagnostics).
	- virb0 - Virtual Bridge 0 is used for NAT (Network Address Translation). Virtual environments (virtual machines) use it to connect to outside networks (Internet, etc.).
	
	Commands
	- ethtool [interface name] - gives you information about the interface (duplex type, link modes, port and others).
	
	NIC Bonding:
	
	Network Interface Card Bonding (Network Bonding) - is a combination of multiple NICs into a single bond interface. It's purpose is to provide high availability (we have two ports and combine them together, each port is 1G, so now we have 2G. This is used for high availability and link aggregation) and reundancy (we get two port and combine them, if one of them dies, the other one keeps working).

	How is Bonding done
	- modprobe bonding - install the bonding driver

	- modinfo bonding - shows if the bonding driver is already installed or not (if description is equal to Ethernet Channel Bonding Driver, then the driver is ready and installed).
	
	- create /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0 - create a file called ifcfg-bond0, with these parameters. This is the bonding file.
		- DEVICE=bond0 
		- TYPE=Bond 	
		- Name=bond0	(name of the bond)
		- BONDING_MASTER=yes (the name of the master, yes - it is a master of itself)
		- BOOTPROTO=none (this is the boot protocol, none - no boot protocol | static - if you want to assign static ip address)
		- ONBOOT=yes (yes - is to enable it when system reboot, no - doesn't start when system reboots)
		-IPADDR=192.168.1.80 	(assign IP address)
		-NETMASK=255.255.255.0 	(assign netmask)
		-GATEWAY=192.168.1.1	(assign gateway)
		-BONDING_OPTS="mode=5 miion=100" 
			(Modes: 
			0 - Round Robin (Packets are sequentially transmitted/recieved through each interfaces one by one)
			Fault Tolerance = No, Load Balancing = Yes

			1 - Active Backup (One NIC active while another NIC is asleep. If the active NIC goes down, another NIC becomes active. Only supported in x86 environments.)
			Fault Tolerance = Yes, Load Balancing = No

			2 - XOR (exclusive OR) (In this mode, the MAC address of the slave NIC is matched up against the incoming request's MAC and once this connection is established, the same NIC is used to transmit/recieve for the destination MAC)
			Fault Tolerance = Yes, Load Balancing = Yes

			3 - Broadcast (All transmissions are sent on all slaves)
			Fault Tolerance = Yes, Load Balancing = No

			4 - Dynamic Link Aggregation (Aggregated NICs act as one NIC which results in a higher throughput, but also provides failover in the case that a NIC fails. Dynamic Link Aggregation requires a switch that support IEEE 702.3ad)
			Fault Tolerance = Yes, Load Balancing = Yes

			5 - Transmition Load Balancing (TLB) (The outgoing traffic is disturbed depending on the current load on each slave interface. Incoming traffic is recieved by the c urrent slave. If the receiving slave fails, another slave takes over the MAC address of the failed slave)
			Fault Tolerance = Yes, Load Balancing = Yes

			6 - Adaptive Load Balancing (ALB) (Unlike DLA, ALB does not require any particular switch configuration. ALB is only supported in x86 environments. The receiving packets are load balanced through ARP negotitation)
			Fault Tolerance = Yes, Load Balancing = Yes
			
			Miion - specifies the MII link monitoring frequency in millseconds. Determines how often the link state of each slave is inspected for link failures.
	
	- edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ethernet1 - edit the first interface file (enp0s3), delete the entire content of the file and add the follwing lines:
		TYPE=Ethernet
		BOOTPROTO=none
		DEVICE=enp0s3 (the name of the first interface)
		ONBOOT=yes
		HWADDR="mac address from the ifconfig"
		MASTER=bond0
		SLAVE=yes
		
	- edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ethernet2
		TYPE=Ethernet
		BOOTPROTO=none
		DEVICE=enp0s8 (the name of the second interface)
		ONBOOT=yes
		HWADDR="mac address from the ifconfig"
		MASTER=bond0
		SLAVE=yes

	- restart network - systemctl restart network
	- test to verify the configuration - ifconfig 
	- /proc/net/bonding/bond0 - bond file that contains interface setting like bonding mode and slave interface

	Network Utilities:
	
	Network Manager (you can create bonds and teams)
		- nmtui (network manager text user interface) - make changes to a interface
		- nmcli (network manager command line interface)
			- nmcli device - returns all interfaces
		- nm-connection-editor (graphical management tool) 
		- GNOME settings (only on GNOME desktop - it has a GUI)
