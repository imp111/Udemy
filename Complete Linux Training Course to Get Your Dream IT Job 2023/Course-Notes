File System Structure:
/ - root directory (the start of the entire file system)
/boot - contains files that are used by the boot loader (grub.cfg)
/root - root user home directory
/etc - contains configuration files
/bin - user commands (/bin, /usr/bin)
/sbin - system/file system commands (/usr/sbin)
/opt - optional add-on applications (not part of the OS apps)
/proc - running processes (only exist in memory)
/lib - C programming library files needed by commands and apps (/usr/lib)
/tmp - directory for temporary files
/home - home directory of every user
/var - system logs 
/run - System daemons that start very early (systemd and udev) to store temporary runtime files like PID files
/mnt - to mount external filesystem (NFS) e.g. for things like external hard drives, flash drives etc.
/media - for cdrom mounts

Commands:
whoami - shows the current logged in user
pwd - print working directory

- Navigating through the files system
cd - change directory
	- ./ - current directory
	- ../ - parent directory
	- Relative Path - It identifies a location relative to you current position (/OperatingSystems/Lectures/)
	- Absolute Path - Always begins with /. It is the path from the root directory to the current position (/home/userName/OperatingSystems/Lectures/)
ls - list
find - 
locate -

- File Permisions
d - directory
- - regular file
l - link
c - special file or device file
s - socket
p - named pipe
b - block device

ls -l Structure:
Type	# of Links	Owner	Group	Size	Month	Day	Time	Name	

- User Administration:
passwd [userName] - change user password
ACL (Access Control List) - gives an user or a group more flexible permissions to access, edit or execute directories and files.
If some user is not part of the group of a directory, we can add him in the ACL and he will be able to access this directory.
setfacl
	setfacl -m u:user:rwx /path/to/file - add perfmissions for user
	setfacl -m g:group:rw /path/to/file - add permissions for a group
	setfacl -Rm "entry" /path/to/file - allow all files or directories to inherit ACL entries from the directory it is within
	setfacl -x u:user /path/to/file - remove a specific entry (for specific user)
	setfacl -b /path/to/file - remove all entries (for all users)

getfacl /path/to/file - get all entries for the specific file

useradd - add user
userdel - remove user
	userdel -r userName - remove user, home directory and email spool
usermod - modify user account
groupadd
groupdel

- Creating Files and Directories:
mkdir - make directory
rmdir - remove empty directories
rm - remove files and directories (you can also remove directories - recursivly)
touch - create files
cp - copy file/files
	cp -R source desitnation - copy directories recursivly
mv - move (can be used to rename files aswell)

- Streams:
0 - stdin
1 - stdout
2 - stderr

>> - append to a file
> - overwrite file

- Standard output to file: 		Use case: (echo "testing tee" | tee testingFile)
tee

- Pipe ( | ):
command1 [arguments] | command2 [arguments] 		- pipe is used to redirect stdout of one command to stdin of another command

- Filters and Text processing commands:
awk (pattern scanning and processing language)
	awk --version						- get awk version
	awk '{print $1}' file1					- print the first column of a file
	ls -l | awk '{print $1, $3}'				- print the first and the third column of the ls -l command output
	ls -l | awk '{print $NF}'				- print the last column of the ls -l command output
	awk '/Jerry/ {print}' file				- search for a specific word in file and returns the entire row if the word matches
	awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd			- output only first field of the /etc/passwd file and use field separator ':'
	echo "Hello World" | awk '{$2 = "Adam"; print $0}'	- replace the second column with the specified word and print all the columns and rows
	cat file | awk '{$2 = "Test"; print $0}'		- replace the second column of the file with the specified word (does not change the content of the file, only the output when printing it) and print all the columns and rows
	awk 'length($0) > 15' file				- get rows that have more than 15 bytes size (15 symbols), changing the $? in the brackets specifies the column that we want to check ($0 all columns, $1 only the first columns, ..., $n etc.)
	ls -l | awk '{if($9 == "Testing stuff") print $0;}'	- if the ninth column of the ouput of the ls -l command is equal to the provided string, then print the entire ls -l command
	ls -l | awk '{print NF}'				- print the number of the last columns of the output from the ls -l command	
grep (print lines matching a pattern)
	grep --version || grep --help || man grep		- get grep help
	grep keyword file					- search for the keyword in the specified file
	grep -c keyword file					- print the count of the matching lines for each file
	grep -i keyword file					- ignore case when searching in file
	grep -n keyword file					- prefix each line 
	grep -v keyword file					- invert matching, find all the non-matching matches
	grep keyword file | awk '{print $1}'			- search for the keyword in the specified file and print only the first column from the matched row
	ls -l | grep Desktop					- search for the Desktop folder from the ls -l output
	egrep -u "keyword | keyword" file			- search for keyword1 or keyword2 in the specified file
sort (sorts in alphabetical order)
	sort --version || sort --help || man sort		- sort manual and help
	sort file						- sort a file (default: alphabetically)
	sort -r file						- reverse order sort
	sort -k2 file						- sort by field number
uniq (filters out the repeated or duplicate lines)
	uniq file						- print only unique lines
	sort file | uniq 					- sort the specified file and then print only the unique lines
	sort file | uniq -c 					- sort the specified file, print the number of duplicated and print the unique lines
	sort file | uniq -d					- sort the specified file and show only repeated lines
wc (word count - returns a count of lines, words or bytes)
	wc --version || wc --help || man wc			- wc manual and help
	wc file							- returns count of the lines, words and bytes and the file name
	wc -c file						- returns count of the bytes and the name of the file
	wc -l							- returns count of the lines
	wc -w							- returns count of the words
	wc -b							- returns count of the bytes
	wc directory						- NOT ALLOWED!
	ls -l | wc -l						- returns the line count of the ls -l command
	grep keyword | wc -l					- returns the line count of the grep keyword command

- Networking Basics:
	
	Basic Terms:
	- IP (Internet Protocol) - identity number for each user in the network
		- IPv4
		- IPv6
	- Subnet Mask - 32-bit number that masks an IP Address, and divides the IP address into network and host address.  
	- Gateway (usualy the ip address of the router in a home network) - the gate that is used to access networks outside of our local area network (a.k.a. the Internet).
	
	- Static vs DHCP IP Addresses - when Static IP is set, it does not change. When the PC is restared it stays the same, while if we use DHCP, the computer will automatically pick one IP from pool of available addresses and it will change everytime we start the computer.

	- Interface (usually this is the Network Card or Wifi Card on laptops) - this is the device that allows the computer to connect to networks and Internet.
	- MAC Address - is the physical address of the Interface card. Every Interface card has a MAC Address. It is permanent and it cannot be changed.	
	
	- OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)
	- NIC (Network Interface Controller)
